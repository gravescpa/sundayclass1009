Now it's time for some math, <%= name %>. Your three favorite numbers are <%= favnum1 %>, <%= favnum2 %> and <%= favnum3 %>.<br>
If we add them together we get <%= sum %><br>
Now give me another number to break up into the lowest amount of coins.

<form method = "post" action = "/change">

	<input type = "number"  name = "jingle">

	<input type = "hidden" name = "input_name" value = <%= name %>>

	<input type = "submit">

</form>
